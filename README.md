# typescript-vue-cli2

This is an example of a vue-cli 2.9.3 application using [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript), [vue-class-component](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component), [vue-property-decorator](https://github.com/kaorun343/vue-property-decorator) and [vuex-class](https://github.com/ktsn/vuex-class) with the Meetup API, I've created it to do a lecture about it on [Vue.js SÃ£o Paulo Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/VueJS-SP/events/247418703/).

You can check it live on [https://alefesouza.github.io/typescript-vue-cli2](https://alefesouza.github.io/typescript-vue-cli2), it's just a very simple application.
